Punch Up!

Overall Objective:
Create a stand-alone portfolio piece

Assignment Objective:
My objective is to create a party game that people can play with each other using a wifi connection, like a lan-party, or jackbox games type of game. 
The idea is based off of an old boardgame that I used to play with my family that I thought would be interesting to have as a more accessible and newly 
updated version as some of the questions are quite dated now.

One player will be given a question that they have to answer, there will be four pre-made answers that the player has to choose from. The other players 
then have to decide which answer that person chose. It’s supposed to be a game where people have to talk to each other and figure out how they think. 
Speaking to each other is encouraged as the questions are supposed to push people to think like one another.

I want to have a database of questions with corresponding answers and learn how to connect multiple devices to a single instance of a game (like a room 
when playing jackbox or similar party games). I plan to try to create the questions myself, most likely with the help of AI so that I can think of enough 
questions and answers for the game.

I think this project would enhance my body of work as it pushes my own boundaries of coding and I will have to do research and deal with multiple different 
things that I am unfamiliar with. I think this project is much more than just front-end, it pushes into fullstack and back-end as well.

I’m nervous about learning how to connect devices to a single game, I’m unsure of how to set that up so I’m sure it will take some time for me to learn 
how to do that. I am also unsure I will have enough time to complete everything. We only have one month and a bit left before we are supposed to be in our 
practicum which makes me a bit nervous but I’m sure everything will work out ok, even if that means that I have to scale back my project a bit.
